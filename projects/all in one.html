      <h3>Project context</h3>
      <p>The company I work for, Crehana, strategically acquired two companies to expand into the HR market in Latin America. 
        Our challenge as designers was to seamlessly integrate these new companies into a single platform and make users feel 
        they had an all-in-one solution.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Understading phase</h3>
      <p>As a team, the first thing we needed to understand was how the newly acquired companies operated. We decided to spend 
        a week gaining a high-level understanding of the services they offered to users and how we could merge them in an optimal way.
        <br><br>
        One of the initial observations was that the three companies had different structures, designs, and technology stacks. 
        This led us to engage in discussions with our tech team to share the challenges we were facing and work together 
        to define the structure we would develop.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        In the design team, we had two proposals for structures, one with the features of an all-in-one and another with the 
        characteristics of a product suite. With these proposals, we met with our head of design and the tech team to present 
        them and determine which structure would be more suitable in terms of time and implementation. The proposal chosen to 
        move forward with was the all-in-one approach.
      </p>

      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Cross platform components</h3>
      <p>
        We defined three main components that would be present in the proposed new structure. These components are:
         <strong>Topbar</strong>, <strong>Navbar</strong>, <strong>Section header</strong>.
      </p>

      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Tokens and variables</h3>
      <p>
        With the defined structure, we saw that it could be an excellent opportunity to implement variables and tokens in 
        this project, helping to save time for the design team by making the new structure just a click away from switching 
        to dark mode.  
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="project-img">
        <video muted autoplay loop  width="100%" >
            <source src="../videos/All_6.mp4"
                type="video/mp4" >
        </video>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h3>New structure adoption</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding all the products and analyzing how they would coexist on a single platform was quite challenging, 
        but we could see how well the structure was embraced by the design team. It's wonderful to witness the designs 
        applied to the new framework as we progress toward becoming an all-in-one platform.
